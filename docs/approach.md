# Ring Vaccination

Ring vaccination is a public health strategy to control the spread of an infectious disease by vaccinating individuals who have been exposed to the disease. In a ring vaccination strategy, after a case has been confirmed, health officials try to identify the patient's close contacts and vaccinate them. Ring vaccination also includes identifying and vaccinating the contacts of those contacts to form a protective "ring" of immunity around infected individuals.  This strategy relies on a few key factors:

- short delays between case identification and diagnosis
- effective isolation of diagnosed cases
- short turn around time for contact tracing the contacts of a case
- contact tracing a high fraction of close contacts
- quick vaccination of those contacts before they become infectious
- post-exposure vaccination is effective at preventing transmission
- contact tracing and vaccinating a high fraction of contacts of contacts


In contrast with pro-active vaccination of individuals based on their prior known risk factors, ring vaccination is a form of reactive vaccination.

## Use of ring vaccination in the past

[Ring vaccination has previously been used as one part of the successful strategy to globally eradicate smallpox, which was declared officially eradicated by the World Health Assembly in 1980. Accounts of the program indicate that the strategy relied on intensive public health surveillance to identify cases early, isolate them, and interview cases to identify their close contacts](https://www.nfid.org/the-triumph-of-science-the-incredible-story-of-smallpox-eradication/). Those contacts were then notified of their exposure, had their health monitored, and were vaccinated. Contacts were also interviewed to identify their contacts, and those contacts of contacts were vaccinated as well.

Ring vaccination has also been an effective strategy in limiting spread of Ebola virus outbreaks. In 2015, a [ring vaccination trial of an Ebola virus vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine) began in Guinea](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)32621-6/fulltext). Interim trial results yielded [evidence of high vaccine efficacy for this approach](https://doi.org/10.1177/17407745211073594). As a result, the World Health Organization Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) endorsed a ring vaccination deployment of the vaccine, as well as vaccinating other at-risk groups, such as health care and front-line workers. Since then, ring vaccination has been used as an effective control strategy for several other Ebola outbreaks, including the [2019 outbreak in DRC](https://www.who.int/news/item/23-09-2019-second-ebola-vaccine-to-complement-ring-vaccination-given-green-light-in-drc#:~:text=The%20main%20vaccination%20strategy%20used,transfer%20skills%20to%20the%20region.).

## Contact tracing

Part of a successful ring vaccination strategy is highly effective contact tracing. Estimates of contact tracing for Ebola have varied substantially between outbreaks and settings, however in West African outbreaks high contract tracing rates have been achieved [needs a link].
