# Ring Vaccination

Ring vaccination is a public health strategy to control the spread of an infectious disease by vaccinating individuals who have been exposed to the disease. In a ring vaccination strategy, after a case has been confirmed, health officials try to identify the patient's close contacts and vaccinate them. Ring vaccination also includes identifying and vaccinating the contacts of those contacts to form a protective "ring" of immunity around infected individuals.  This strategy relies on effective contact tracing that is able to:

- (1) trace a high fraction of close contacts and vaccinate them
- (2) quickly find contacts before they become infectious
- (3) assumes that post exposure vaccination is effective at preventing transmission


In contrast with pro-active vaccination of individuals based on their prior known risk factors, ring vaccination is a form of reactive vaccination.

## Use of ring vaccination in the past

Ring vaccination has previously been used as one part of the successful strategy to globally eradicate smallpox, which was declared officially eradicated by the World Health Assembly in 1980. Accounts of the program indicate that the strategy relied on intensive public health surveillance to identify cases early, isolate them, and interview cases to identify their close contacts. A high rate of those contacts were then notified of their exposure, had their health monitored, and were vaccinated. Contacts were also interviewed to identify their contacts, and those contacts of contacts were vaccinated as well.

Ring vaccination has also been an effective strategy in limiting spread of Ebola virus outbreaks. In 2015, a ring vaccination trial of an Ebola virus vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine) began in Guinea (link to Ebola ca Suffit trial). Interim trial results of the randomized rings yielded evidence of high vaccine efficacy fot this approach. As a result, the World Health Organization Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) endorsed a ring vaccination deployment of the vaccine, as well as vaccinating other at-risk groups, such as health care and front-line workers. Since then, ring vaccination has been used as an effective control strategy for several other Ebola outbreaks, including the 2019 outbreak in DRC.
