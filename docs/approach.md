# Ring Vaccination

Ring vaccination is a public health strategy to control the spread of an infectious disease by vaccinating individuals who have been exposed to the disease. In a ring vaccination strategy, after a case has been confirmed, health officials try to identify the patient's close contacts and vaccinate them. Ring vaccination also includes identifying and vaccinating the contacts of those contacts to form a protective "ring" of immunity around infected individuals.  This strategy relies on effective contact tracing that is able to:

- (1) trace a high fraction of close contacts and vaccinate them
- (2) quickly find contacts before they become infectious
- (3) assumes that post exposure vaccination is effective at preventing transmission


In contrast with pro-active vaccination of individuals based on their prior known risk factors, ring vaccination is a form of reactive vaccination. 

## Use of ring vaccination in the past

Ring vaccination has previously been used as one part of the successful strategy to globally eradicate smallpox, 


 This strategy relied on intenstive public health surveillance to identify cases early on, isolate them, and interview cases to identify their close contacts. Those contacts
