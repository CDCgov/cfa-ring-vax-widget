# Ring vaccination widget

## Overview

This repo contains code for investigating the potential efficacy of ring
vaccination for a disease interactively via a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
app.

## Model description

### Skateboard version

- Disease progression: susceptible, exposed/latent (i.e., will go onto
  infection), infectious, recovered
- Infection process
  - Finite number of generations: index infection, generation 1 (contacts),
    generation 2 (contacts of contacts), and generation 3
  - Number of infections
    - For first version, assume that all infections have i.i.d. number of
      offspring (i.e., branching process)
    - Index infection creates a number of generation 1 infections, drawn from
      some distribution
    - Generation 1 infections each create a number of generation 2 infections
      - These values are drawn jointly (i.e., from a multivariate distribution)
      - All network features are marginalized over this distribution
      - The potential for correlations between numbers of infections (e.g., that
        generation 2 infections might share contacts) are all baked into that
        distribution
    - Similarly for generations 2 and 3
      - The distribution can vary between the three generations
  - Timing of infections
    - For first version, just space the infections uniformly in time
    - For later versions, spacing them like for a Poisson process
- Passive detection (i.e., self-detection)
  - Each infection has an independent probability of passive detection
  - If passively detected, detection occurs at some time distribution since
    exposure
  - (No assumption that index case is passively detected)
- Contact tracing (i.e., active detection)
  - Every detected infection (whether passive or active) has an independent
    probability of triggering contact tracing
  - Contact tracing has an independent probability of detecting each infection
    caused by the detected infection
  - "Detection" means detection _and_ successful intervention
  - There is a distribution of times between triggering detection and contact
    tracing completion
- Input parameters/assumptions for this model
  - Latent period $t_\mathrm{latent}$ distribution (time from contact to onset
    of infectiousness)
  - Infectious period $t_\mathrm{inf}$ distribution
  - Infectious rate (which could be defined via $R_0 / E[t_\mathrm{inf}]$)
  - Distribution of infections (start by making these independent, Poisson)
  - Passive detection probability and delay distribution
  - Contact tracing probability and delay distribution
- Implementation/initialization
  - Seed a single infection (e.g., exposed via travel)
- Output/viz
  - Some discrete realizations, showing the timelines of events for individuals
    (e.g., how the different disease state periods line up in time)
  - Distribution of number of undetected in generation 3

### Fuller version

- Disease progression: susceptible, exposed (i.e., will go onto infection),
  infectious, recovered
- Individuals make contacts on some network, with some effective (i.e.,
  infection transmitting) contact rate. (Contact rates and effective contact
  probability could be separated in parameter input, but they are perfectly
  confounded in the model.)
- Each infected individual can be detected. E.g., infected people might notice
  their own symptoms.
- When an infected person is detected, contact tracing and isolation are
  initiated.
  - Contact tracing
    - Contact tracing can detect infections among contacts, contacts of
      contacts, etc.
    - Contact tracing has different performance characteristics for each "ring."
      (The most straightforward choice would be to make second ring performance
      equivalent to first ring, i.e., time from detecting infected contact to
      infected contact-of-contact is identical to time from detecting index
      infection to infected contact.)
  - Isolation reduces transmission by some factor (which might be 100%) for that
    individual.
- Input parameters/assumptions for this model
  - Latent period $t_\mathrm{latent}$ distribution (time from contact to onset
    of infectiousness)
  - Infectious period $t_\mathrm{inf}$ distribution
  - Basic reproductive number $R_0$ (i.e., mean number of secondary infections
    per index infection in the absence of intervention)
    - Note: this defines some mean infectious rate $R_0 / E[t_\mathrm{inf}]$
    - Assume that this infectious rate is constant over the period of
      infectiousness. E.g., if perfectly effective isolation is implemented
      halfway through an individual's infectious period, that halves their
      number of expected secondary infections.
    - Some distribution of number of secondary infections around $R_0$ (e.g.,
      Poisson)
    - Assume that the number of secondary infections is uncorrelated across
      individuals (i.e., there is some kind of homogeneity in the contact
      network).
  - Per-infection detection (aka "passive" detection, in which individuals
    identify their own symptoms)
    - % of infections identified in this way (in the absence of contact tracing)
    - Distribution of times from exposure to detection (or, equivalently, from
      exposure to symptom onset and from symptom onset to detection)
  - Contact tracing
    - % of first ring (contacts) identified
    - Distribution of times from index exposure to contact identification
    - Time-varying performance of contact tracing (e.g., a simple assumption
      would be that all infected contacts immediately stop infecting, i.e., that
      the diagnostic test can identify infections with 100% sensitivity
      immediately after exposure and isolation is 100% effective)
    - % of second ring (contacts of contacts) identified, distribution of times,
      etc.
    - Third ring, etc.
- Implementation/initialization
  - Seed a single infection (e.g., exposed via travel)
  - **_Open question_**: How to deal with multiple rings?
    - What are the network implications of treating undetected infections as new
      index infections (with independent but identically distributed number of
      secondary infections)?
    - How hard would it be to simulate contacts on a simple network?
- Output/viz
  - Some discrete realizations, showing the timelines of events for individuals
    (e.g., how the different disease state periods line up in time)
  - Distribution of number of undetected
- Assumptions of note
  - Assuming independence is conservative: clustering helps you
