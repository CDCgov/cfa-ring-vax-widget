# Ring vaccination widget

## Overview

This repo contains code for investigating the potential efficacy of ring
vaccination for a disease interactively via a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
app.

## Model description

- Disease progression:
  - Susceptible
  - Exposed/latent (i.e., will go on to infection)
  - Infectious
  - Recovered
- Infection process
  - There are a finite number of generations
    - Start with 4: index infection (i.e., generation 0), generation 1
      (contacts), generation 2 (contacts of contacts), and generation 3
      (potential escaping infections)
    - In general, this number could be varied
  - Number of infections generated by infected people
    - Assume branching process (i.e., each infections yields an i.i.d. number of
      offspring)
    - Assume it's a Poisson process: draw inter-infection times from
      $\mathrm{Exp}(1/\lambda)$ until infectious period ends or infection is
      detected
      - N.B.: All "contacts" here are effective contacts, i.e., encounters that
        result in transmission
- Passive detection (i.e., self-detection)
  - Each infection has an independent probability of passive detection
  - If passively detected, detection occurs at some time distribution since
    exposure.
    - Start with Dirac delta distribution (i.e., all passively-detected
      infections are detected at some fixed delay after exposure)
    - N.B.: This assumes that progression of infectiousness and symptoms are
      independent. We could not say that, e.g., symptoms being immediately upon
      onset of infectiousness, and the delay to self-detection is some time
      after that.
  - N.B.: There is no assumption that index case is passively detected. If the
    index case does not self-detect, this is not an automatic fail, since they
    might not infect anyone, or their infectees might self-detect.
- Contact tracing (i.e., active detection)
  - Every detected infection (whether passive or active) has an independent
    probability of triggering contact tracing
  - Contact tracing has an independent probability of detecting each infection
    caused by the detected infection
    - N.B.: Contact tracing goes only forward and only one generation. For
      example, say index infects A infects B infects C, and the is passively
      detected, but A is passively detected. Then this creates an chance to
      actively detect B, but not the index or C (although C might be detected if
      the detection of A leads to contact tracing that detects B that in turn
      leads to contact tracing that detects C).
    - N.B.: "Detection" here means detection _and_ successful intervention. We
      do not separately model the detected infection's probability of divulging
      contact information, the ability of public health to find that contact, or
      the probability of that contact to comply with quarantine/isolation.
  - There is a distribution of times between triggering detection and contact
    tracing completion. Start with Dirac delta.
- Input parameters/assumptions for this model
  - Latent period $t_\mathrm{latent}$ distribution (time from contact to onset
    of infectiousness). Start with Dirac delta.
  - Infectious period $t_\mathrm{inf}$ distribution. Start with Dirac delta.
  - Infectious rate. Start with identical for all people.
    - Make this an input parameter, and for convenience, display
      $R_0 = \mathrm{rate} / E[t_\mathrm{inf}]$ in the widget as a derived
      parameter
  - Network/contact structure: see above; these are i.i.d. Poisson
  - Passive detection probability and delay distribution: Dirac delta
  - Contact tracing probability and delay distribution: Dirac delta
- Initialization: Seed a single infection (e.g., exposed via travel)
- Outputs
  - Number of detected and undetected infections in each generation
  - Event log, including:
    - Who infected whom
    - Timing of detections, disease state transitions, etc.

### Out of scope

- Could we make a correlated draw of infections in each generation sufficient to
  describe certain network parameters? Or do you also need timing?
- If two people in generation $g$ contact an infection in generation $g+1$, and
  both of the $g$ infections are detected, does the $g+1$ infection get two
  chances for contact tracing to work?

## Analysis

- Define a "successful" simulation as one with zero 4th-generation infections
