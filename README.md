# Ring vaccination widget

## Overview

This repo contains code for investigating the potential efficacy of ring
vaccination for a disease interactively via a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
app.

## Model description

- Disease progression:
  - Susceptible
  - Exposed/latent (i.e., will go on to infection)
  - Infectious
  - Recovered
- Infection process
  - There are a finite number of generations
    - Start with 4: index infection (i.e., generation 0), generation 1
      (contacts), generation 2 (contacts of contacts), and generation 3
      (potential escaping infections)
    - In general, this number could be varied
  - Assume
  - Number of infections generated by infected people
    - Assume branching process (i.e., each infections yields an i.i.d. number of
      offspring)
    - Assume it's a Poisson process: draw inter-infection times from
      $\mathrm{Exp}(1/\lambda)$ until infectious period ends or infection is
      detected
- Passive detection (i.e., self-detection)
  - Each infection has an independent probability of passive detection
  - If passively detected, detection occurs at some time distribution since
    exposure. Start with Dirac delta distribution.
  - (N.B.: No assumption that index case is passively detected)
- Contact tracing (i.e., active detection)
  - Every detected infection (whether passive or active) has an independent
    probability of triggering contact tracing
  - Contact tracing has an independent probability of detecting each infection
    caused by the detected infection
  - "Detection" means detection _and_ successful intervention
  - There is a distribution of times between triggering detection and contact
    tracing completion. Start with Dirac delta.
- Input parameters/assumptions for this model
  - Latent period $t_\mathrm{latent}$ distribution (time from contact to onset
    of infectiousness). Start with Dirac delta.
  - Infectious period $t_\mathrm{inf}$ distribution. Start with Dirac delta.
  - Infectious rate. Start with identical for all people.
    - Make this an input parameter, and for convenience, display
      $R_0 = \mathrm{rate} / E[t_\mathrm{inf}]$ in the widget as a derived
      parameter
  - Network/contact structure: see above; these are i.i.d. Poisson
  - Passive detection probability and delay distribution: Dirac delta
  - Contact tracing probability and delay distribution: Dirac delta
- Implementation/initialization
  - Seed a single infection (e.g., exposed via travel)
- Output/viz
  - Some discrete realizations, showing the timelines of events for individuals
    (e.g., how the different disease state periods line up in time)
  - Distribution of number of undetected in generation 4 (contacts of contacts
    of contacts)

### Questions for future development

- Is the correlated draw of infections in each generation sufficient to describe
  certain network parameters? Or do you also need timing?

### Out of scope

- If two people in generation $g$ contact an infection in generation $g+1$, and
  both of the $g$ infections are detected, does the $g+1$ infection get two
  chances for contact tracing to work?
